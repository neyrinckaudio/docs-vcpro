!!! warning "Ethernet Surfaces With Windows - Npcap Utility Required"
    The Windows OS does not provide for Ethernet 2 connectivity. To use legacy ethernet surfaces, you must install the "Npcap" utility so that V-Control Pro can connect to legacy hardware. V-Control Pro will message you if "Npcap" is not installed and will point you to a free utility for you to install. At the time of this writing, it is available at [NPcap.com](https://npcap.com/#download)

## Firewire Devices

!!! warning "V-Control Pro Does Not Provide Firewire Drivers"
    You must install a 003 firewire driver that allows the Mac or Windows computer to provide audio I/O and MIDI I/O. Last time we looked, Avid's drivers do not work well with modern computers, especially Mac systems.
