## Legacy Digidesign/Avid Surfaces
Digidesign and Avid manufactured superb control surfaces that connected to Pro Tools HD / Ultimate. Over time, Avid has stopped supporting these surfaces. V-Control Pro connects these surfaces to all modern versions of Pro Tools Studio, Pro Tools Ultimate, Pro Tools First, etc. And V-Control Pro connects these surfaces to many other media applications such as Logic Pro, Cubase, Nuendo, Studio One, and many more audio, video, and MIDI applications.
