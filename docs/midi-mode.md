# Using MIDI Mode

V-Control Pro provides a virtual MIDI port named "V-Control MIDI Mode" that lets control surfaces send and receive MIDI CC messages to applications and plugins that provide custom MIDI mapping. At the time of this writing, Pro Control, Control 24, C24, and D-Command provide MIDI Mode.

When a surface is not connected to a DAW, V-Control Pro defaults the surface to MIDI mode.
