# Setting Up Firewire Controllers

## Digidesign 003

The Digidesign 003 uses a Firewire cable to connect to the computer. A compatible 003 driver must be installed.

!!! warning "V-Control Pro Does Not Provide Firewire Drivers"
    You must install a 003 firewire driver that allows the Mac or Windows computer to provide audio I/O and MIDI I/O. Last time we looked, Avid's drivers do not work well with modern computers, especially Mac systems.
