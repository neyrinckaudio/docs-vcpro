If your computer does not have an internet connection, you must place the license on a computer that has an internet connection for it to be refreshed for the next monthly period. This has to be done once a year if your license is not on a computer that is connected to the internet. 
You can use the iLok License Manager or log in to your account on ilok.com to check on the expiration date for the license.
