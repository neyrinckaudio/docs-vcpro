# V-Control Pro Licensing

V-Control Pro uses iLok licensing to enable its powerful features. A license can be activated on the computer running V-Control Pro or on an iLok USB key which makes it very easy to move the license between computers. You can [learn more at ilok.com](https://ilok.com).

## Activating A License
When you purchase a license or you request a trial license, a license will be deposited to your iLok user account. To use a licensee, it must be activated. You can activate a trial or purchased license in two ways:

### 1️⃣ Activate A License Using V-Control Pro

* Launch the V-Control Pro app on the host computer.

* Select Activate License….

* Select Activate when the license authorization prompt appears.

* Enter the ilok ID and password used when purchasing the V-Control Pro license.

* Select the V-Control Pro license to activate it and select Next.

* Choose the location to place the license. V-Control Pro licenses can be activated directly on the computer or on an ilok USB key. An iLok USB key is most convenient because you can easily move it between computer systems.

### 2️⃣ Activate A License Using iLok License Manager

* Launch the iLok License Manager application on the host computer.

* Log in to your iLok user account.

* Locate the V-Control Pro license.

* Drag the license to your iLok or computer.

The V-Control Pro license will now be activated and V-Control Pro will operate with all supported features and functions.

## Subscription Licenses
A V-Control Pro subscription license must be refreshed annually. The refresh is an automatic process that is done through an internet connection. If your computer does not have an internet connection, you must place the license on a computer that has an internet connection for it to be refreshed for the next monthly period. This has to be done once a year if your license is not on a computer that is connected to the internet. 
You can use the iLok License Manager or log in to your account on ilok.com to check on the expiration date for the license.
