    |  | VButtonSet: Use this mode to create and cycle through different button set points. With the mouse hovering above the on screen button's position press Shift+Solo on the control surface to set a Pin at that location. Using the fader in this mode will cylce between multiple Pins to use with VButton mode. |
    |  | VWKnob: Use this mode when interacting with knob controls on the plug-ins GUI. |
