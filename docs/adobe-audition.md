# Adobe Audition

* In the Audition top menu bar select: Audition Audition CC/Preferences/Control Surface...
* Select Device Class: Mackie
* Select Configure to open Configure Mackie Control window
* Configure Mackie Control as the following:
    * Device Type: Mackie Control
    * MIDI Input Device: V-Control
    * MIDI Output Device: V-Control

Here is how to setup additional controllers for up to 32 tracks of control.

In the Configure Mackie Controller window, click on Add and set up as:

* Device Type: Mackie Control XT
* MIDI Input Device: V-Control XT2
* MIDI Output Device: V-Control XT2
* Repeat this step replacing V-Control XT2 with V-Control XT3 and V-Control XT4 for 32 tracks total.

!!! note
    For the Channel/Bank Select buttons to function, there needs to be more created audio tracks in the session than the amount of tracks setup for V-Control Pro to control.

For example, if V-Control Pro is setup for 16 tracks of control in Audition, then there would need to be at least 17 created tracks in the session for the Channel/Bank select buttons to work.
