# Multiple HUI Controllers With Pro Tools

Pro Tools does not let you set up multiple HUI controllers that operate independently. V-Control Pro solves this limitation.

V-Control Pro lets you connect multiple HUI protocol surfaces to Pro Tools, such as keyboards and moving fader devices, in parallel, as well as the non-HUI surfaces supported by V-Control Pro. 

One common application of this is to use V-Console or V-Control For iPad to remotely control Pro Tools while your normal fader surface still works as expected.

Another application is to connect a keyboard controller with transport control in addition to a fader controller.

### Setup

#### Add HUI Protocol Device To The Setups Window

First, you must add your HUI Protocol Device as a controller in the V-Control Pro Setups window as described in [Setting Up MIDI Controllers](./midi-controllers.md).

#### Pro Tools
Set up Pro Tools for 1,2,3, or 4 HUI banks (matching your main device) as described in [Setting Up Pro Tools](./pro-tools.md).
