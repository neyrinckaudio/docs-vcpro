# HUI Protocol Devices

V-Control Pro lets you connect HUI protocol surfaces (such as ones made by SSL, Behringer, PreSonus, etc.) in parallel with any of the non-HUI surfaces supported by V-Control Pro while controlling Pro Tools. A common application of this is to use V-Console or V-Control For iPad along with your surface. You can use HUI surfaces up to 32 channels wide.

### Setup

#### Add HUI Protocol Device To The Setups Window

First, you must add your HUI Protocol Device as a controller in the V-Control Pro Setups window as described in [Setting Up MIDI Controllers](./midi-controllers.md).

#### Pro Tools
Set up Pro Tools for 1,2,3, or 4 HUI banks (matching your HUI device) as described in [Setting Up Pro Tools](./pro-tools.md).
